Created 4 classes for the 4 different types of Electronic Items .<br>
Television and Console can have Extras , Although Extras for Consoles were limited to 4. <br>
These 2 classes have some special methods to handle extras : <br>
<ul>
<li>getTotalPriceOfExtras()</li>
<li>addExtras()</li>
<li>getTotalNumOfExtraItems()</li>
</ul>
However these Methods are commented out in Controller and Microwave types as they are not permitted to have extras.
